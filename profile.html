      <h2> I am Jimmy Jam</h2>
      
      <p>
        As a seasoned educator with 10 years of experience teaching and training individuals from diverse backgrounds, 
        I have always been passionate about helping others achieve their goals. However, I've recently decided to pivot my career and pursue 
        a career in technology by becoming a Full Stack Developer.
        Throughout my years in education, I've developed strong soft skills such as communication, collaboration, and empathy, which I believe will be invaluable in my new role as a developer. These skills have allowed me to effectively connect with my students and colleagues, 
        understand their needs, and work towards a common goal.
        
        In  addition to my soft skills, I've also developed a keen problem-solving mindset, which is being even further enhanced through my recent 
        Full Stack Web-Development Bootcamp at Spiced Academy in Berlin.

        I'm excited to continue my journey in this new field and to leverage my unique background and skills along the way.
        
        Let's connect and explore how we can work together to build a better tomorrow.</p>
